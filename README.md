# Batch-wise-Optimal-Transport-Metric

## Introduction
We propose an importance-driven distance metric learning via optimal transport programming from batches of samples, construct a new batch-wise optimal transport loss and combine it into an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. It can emphasize hard samples automatically and lead to significant improvements in convergence.
